The rootfinder.py script contains implementations of three different root finding algorithms.

Bisection uses a bisection algorithm to find the root of a given function. This will exit if the two bounds given do not contain a root (or contain an even number of roots). The code continues creating smaller and smaller windows that contain the root until the width of the window is less than the given threshold.

Newton uses the newton method to find the root, which depends on both the function aand the derivative.

Secant uses the secant method, which behaves similarly to the newton method but without the requirement of knowing the derivative.

run_test will test these three root finding algorithms. Examples of how to use them can be found in examples.py


The interpolation.py script contains two different methods to interpolate given a data set.

Piecewise_linear will take in two arrays of data, x and y, and return a function to interpolate for you. This uses a simple linear interpolation.

Natural_cubic behaves similarly to piecewise_linear, however it uses natural cubic splines to interpolate. This will also return a function that you can use to interpolate at any point.

Both of these interpolations will give you values outside the range of available data (extrapolating). In both cases it extrapolates by continuing the end pieces of the piecewise functions out to infinity. This is not guaranteed to be accurate, and the code will print a warning.
